    HTML is the structure and information of a web page, and is in a way the simplest.
    HTML works with a tags that describe content, p for paragraphs, h for headers and so on.
    A tag will generally describe what kind of cantent to come.
    Tags have attribute, some are specific to only certain tags some are not.
    class is an attribute which will be looked for by css to change the style of the element.
    href is an attribute special to the a tag that tells the browser to go to a certain page.

  <!--
        The head is mostly just metadata for the browser, it does things like fetches css pages, and setting the title.
    -->
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <!--
        This shows up as text on the tab of most browsers.
    -->
    <title>Training Codebase</title>
    <!--
        This is how HTML tells the browser it should go get a css file
    -->

         They are also usually bold.

        The nav tag is just a way to organize where you are putting the pages navigation.
        It has no speacial styling around it.
    -->
    <nav class="nav">
      <!--
            ul stands for unorderd list. It is used for listing thisn usually comes with a bullet point.
            There is also ol which numbers the things in the list.

            buttons come with some simple default styling and click functionality.
            What it does on a click you have to define with javascript.
            Here I set an onclick event. The browser will wait for the button to be clicked then it will call that function.
            This function is pulled from a javascript file later in the code.
        -->
      <button class="color-button" onclick="toggleColors()">Make colors</button>
      <p>Lots of awesome content</p>
    </content>
    <!--
        This is how HTML tells the file to go get a javascript file.
        We generally put it last so the browser will render the page for trying to read the file.
        We do this so if the file is big people will see what is on the HTML before this file is ready.

    <script src="home.js"></script>
